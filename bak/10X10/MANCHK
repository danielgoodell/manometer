               COMPLETED BY: ________________________ DATE:_______      


A).  SUPPLY PRESSURE SYSTEM SET-UP

   ______  Power ON system vacuum pump located in the basement.

   ______  In data room power ON to ESP unit (DPT6400).
           
   ______  Close vacuum vent valve.

   ______  Open vacuum supply valve.

   ______  Adjust vacuum regulator to read at least 25 IN HG VAC on gage.
                   
   ______  Turn supply, span 1 and span 2 regulators fully counter-clockwise 
           (but not out of the regulators).

   ______  Close air vent valve.

   ______  Open air supply valve.

   ______  Adjust supply regulator to read 90 psig on supply gage.
          
   ______  Adjust span 2 regulator to read 25 psig on span 2 gage.
           
   ______  Adjust span 1 regulator to read 5 psig on span 1 gage.
          

B. RUN DISPLAY PROGRAM

   ______  Turn ON power to Transducer Interconnect Panel located above
           DPT unit.

   ______  Verify that power is ON to computer. If not on, power up computer.
           Computer will automatically boot-up and run pressure profile program.
              ** If computer is already on and program is not running, 
                 press computer RESET button to re-boot computer and run 
                 pressure profile program.

   ______  Press CAL button located on panel above DPT unit to calibrate
           DPT unit.

   ______  Turn ON power to pressure profile CRT located in the
           control room above operator's console.

   ______  On CRT verify that the profiles are level and reading 
           atmosphere.
              ** If profiles are not level or are showing instability,
                 Re-calibrate the ESP unit by pressing the CAL button
                 located on the panel above the DPT unit.
