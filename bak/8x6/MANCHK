            COMPLETED BY: ______________________  DATE:________


A. PRESSURE SYSTEM SET-UP


   ______  Assure power is ON to ESP unit (DPT6400).
        
   ______  Close vent valve V8.

   ______  Open vacuum supply valve V7.

   ______  Adjust regulator R4 to read 20 IN HG VAC on gage G4.
           (zero pressure)

   ______  Turn regulators R1 & R2 fully counter-clockwise (but not
           out of the regulators).

   ______  Close vent valve V2.

   ______  Open supply valve V1.

   ______  Adjust regulator R1 to read 85 psig on gage G1.
           (shuttle pressure)

   ______  Adjust regulator R2 to read 12 psig on gage G2.
           (span pressure)



B. RUN DISPLAY PROGRAM


   ______  Turn ON power to computer.  Computer will automatically
           boot-up and run pressure profile program.

        ** If computer is already on, press computer RESET button to
           re-boot computer and run pressure profile program.

   ______  Turn ON power to pressure profile CRT'S located in the
           control room (1 above each operator's console)

   ______  On CRT'S verify that the profiles are level and reading 
           atmosphere.

       **  If profiles are not level or are showing instability,
           Re-calibrate the ESP unit by pressing the CAL button.


               REPORT ANY PROBLEMS TO THE OPERATIONS ENGINEER.
